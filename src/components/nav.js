        Tabs organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are
        related and at the same level of hierarchy.

        A navigation bar is a user interface element within a webpage that
        contains links to other sections of the website.
        <br />
        <br />
        In most cases, the navigation bar is part of the main website template,
        which means it is displayed on most, if not all, pages within the
        website. This means that no matter what page you are viewing, you can
        use the navigation bar to visit other sections of the website.
        <br />
        <br />
        A website navigation bar is most commonly displayed as horizontal list
        of links at the top of each page. It may be below the header or logo,
        but it is always placed before the main content of the page.
        <br />
        <br />
        In some cases, it may make sense to place the navigation bar vertically
        on the left side of each page. This type of navigation bar is also
        called a sidebar, since it appears to the side of the primary content.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some websites have both a horizontal navigation bar at the top and a
        vertical navigation bar on the left side of each page like this one!.
